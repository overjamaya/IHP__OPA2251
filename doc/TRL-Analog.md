# Analog IP Quality Assessment using TRL scale

The provided set of the quality assessment criteria, using TRL (Technology Readiness Level) scale, is a tool for designers to auto evaluate a submitted design. The purpose of this tool is to
have a short overview of IP in terms of its maturity.

---

## TRL1 - Basic principles observed

- [x] Is the IP functionality clearly described?
- [x] Is the IP principle of operation explained in detail?
- [ ] Are the IP architecture design equations fully listed?
- [ ] Do authors supply any HDL functional model (e.g. Verilog-A) of the IP?
- [ ] Are functional simulation results of the IP reported for a typical case?

## TRL2 - Concept formulation

- [x] Is the IP architecture described at block level?
- [x] Are the specifications of each individual block of the IP architecture clearly identified?
- [x] Do authors supply a complete test bench to validate the IP block-level architecture?

- [x] Are the authors defining the supply domains of the IP and their individual power requirements?
- [ ] Does the IP description include any power consumption model (e.g. as a function of input stimuli or applied load)?

## TRL5 - Full design at layout level

- [ ] Is the IP complete layout available?
